# fleschIndex

This program calculates the Flesch Index for any given text file. It also calculates the syllable count, word count and sentence count.

In 1949, Dr. Rudolph Flesch developed a formula for estimating the “readability” of written 
material based on the average number of words per sentence and the average number of 
syllables per word.

The readability index gives an idea of how easy the material is to understand.


| Index  | Readability |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| 90-100 | Very easy |
| 80-90  | Easy |
|70-80 | Fairly easy |
|60-70 | “Plain English” |
|50-60 | Fairly difficult |
|30-50 | Difficult |
|< 30 | Very difficult |
